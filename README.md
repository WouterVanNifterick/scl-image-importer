# scl-image-importer

SCL Image Importer

Takes a folder with jpg images and json files, and imports relevant information into the database.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- **NodeJS**
  Either install like `choco install nodejs` or grab the latest version here: [NodeJs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- **IDE**
  To develop, any code editor will do, but `Visual Studio Code` and `PHPStorm` are recommended environments.

- **Database**
  A list of images is pulled from the Scapeye MySQL database.

- **Images**
  Images are stored on disk, and not in the database. The database only contains the paths of the images.
